- I want to outsource logics relate to backend management in QuantizationManager to a new class: QuantizationBackend
- I want to outsource logics relate to "fx" in QuantizationManager to a new class
- I want to outsource logics relate to metric calculating in QuantizationManager to a new class
- I want to integrate logics relate to "dynamic quantization" in QuantizationManager to class DynamicQuantizer
- I want to integrate logics relate to "static quantization" in QuantizationManager to class StaticQuantizer
- I want to integrate logics relate to "quantization aware training" in QuantizationManager to class QATQuantizer
- Check QuantizationBackend not have attr backend_config
- ...


---

- In `QuantizationManager`, move and integrate `compare_accuracy`, `evaluate_accuracy`, `compare_accuracy` to QuantizationMetrics
- In `QuantizationManager`, move and integrate `create_backend_pattern_config`, `setup_fusion` to `QuantizationBackend`
- Add new class, `QuantizationAnalyzer`, move/integrates other method/attributes (QuantizationManager: analyze_quantization, get_model_size, visualize_weight_comparison, visualize_quantization_effects, ...) from other classes to this class
- In `QuantizationManager`, move and integrate `set_custom_qconfig` to `QuantizationConfig`
- I want to integrate logics relate to "quantization aware training" in QuantizationManager (set_qat_learning_rate, ..) to class QATQuantizer

---

- In `QuantizationManager`, add `profile_model` to  `QuantizationAnalyzer`
- In `QuantizationManager`, implement `apply_cross_layer_equalization`
- In `QuantizationManager`, should i move `set_backend_config`, `set_backend` to `QuantizationBackend`?
- In `QuantizationManager`, shoud i move `quantize_per_channel`, `quantize_dynamic` to `FXQuantization`?


- In `QuantizationManager`, add `` to  ``
- In `QuantizationManager`, add `` to  ``
